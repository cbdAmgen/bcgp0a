#' bcgp0a: a package for implementing Bayesian Composite Gaussian Processes
#'
#' The bcgp0a package performs MCMC and blah, blah, blah. Implemented purely in R.
#' It probably won't be fast at all, but I want to get something completed.
#' Also not well documented. It's basically a translation of the ugly MATLAB original
#' code.
